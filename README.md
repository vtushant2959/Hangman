# Hangman
Hangman in C++ is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The program randomly selects a word, displays underscores for unguessed letters, and updates them as the player guesses correctly. Wrong guesses reduce chances until the word is guessed or attempts run out.
